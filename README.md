# recipe-maker-front

This is a project that will be used for future and larger projects. It will probably be used as a base for a few private projects.

Currently the frontend and backend is seperated in projects, but that may or may not be changed in future.
Frontend is a Vue based project that handles creating new ingredients and recipes. The backend is a graphql server that as of writing this, saves the data to firestore.
